Create custom crochet charts


## the problem:
The current options for building crochet charts and diagrams are either:
  1) Hand draw it on graph paper, and erase or retrace every time you need to edit OR
  2) Rely on less-than-intuitive software, often built for other purposes

## the goal(s)
An easy-to-use web app that makes drafting and editing custom crochet charts *almost* as easy as reading them. Important features to include:
  1) Chart any number of stitches in any number of rows or rounds
  2) Choice of US or UK terms
  3) Multi-color support
  4) Full library of standard symbols
  5) Snap-to-grid
  6) Automatic symbol rotation for charts in the round
  7) Symbol brush for large areas of uninterrupted stitching

Additional stretch goals:
  1) Live mirroring
  2) Written instruction generator
  3) Save and reuse custom stitch groups
  4) Library of common motifs such as granny stitch and shells
  5) Support for tunisian crochet
